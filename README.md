## About
A fresh graduate with a Bachelor's degree in design, specializing in Visual Communications. Despite being a freelancer without traditional work experience, I have gained valuable internship experience that has helped me develop my skills and expertise. As I strive to become a professional in the industry, I focus on collaborating with companies to address concrete challenges. Through my work, I am committed to keeping myself updated on the latest techniques and procedures in graphic design to develop creative and unique solutions. While my expertise lies in graphic design, my role extends beyond that of a mere designer as I am also a skilled problem solver. Moving forward, I aim to utilize my problem-solving abilities and enhance my communication, critical, and analytical skills by transitioning into international business administration.
